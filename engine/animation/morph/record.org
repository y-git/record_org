*** record
**** Face3 not has "morphFaceNormals","morphVertexNormals" attri.
because the data is huge, and it will occupy much memory.
so just the ModelGeometry add "morphFaceNormals","morphVertexNormals" attri to save the whole data

**** why don't "direct compute morphNormal(Face,Vertex normal)?"
because when compute morph vertex normals, it need the morph face normals(read from ModelGeometry->morphFaceNormals),
but this data may lost some face normals data,
(
if the vertex is not duplicate,
(means the triangle share vertexs. e.g. the indice is like 0, 1, 2,  0, 2, 3; not like 0,1,2 ,3, 4, 5)
then the latter face normal will rewrite the former face normal in the shared vertexs, so it will lost the former face
normal data
)

so the vertex normal may be wrong.

so here i use the "create temp ModelGeometry to compute" like threejs->Geometry->computeMorphNormals!
