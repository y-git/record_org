* hook exec order
global hook
onStartLoop
onEndLoop



GameObject hook
onEnter
onExit
init
update
onDispose



the script's onEnter,onExit before the loopBody is invoked will not be invoked, because the script is not loaded into
engine at that time  


the execution of hook is to ensure it can get the most info, so onDispose,onExit hook is invoked first in GameObject->dispose,
while other hook is invoked last in method(like init in GameObject->init)
