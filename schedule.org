The initialize method of the script is not called again. Instead the old script instance is passed into the swap method
and it is up to the developer to ensure that the state of the old script is copied into the new one.


Declared script attributes are automatically copied over into the new script instance.

*** TODO support webgl1 extensions which already are supported
e.g. OES_element_index_uint



*** TODO VAO

(optimize: judge last sended vao buffer)



webgl 2? just use extension in webgl 1!
To save a lot of API calls, use vertex array objects (VAOs) or interleave static vertex data. 




that can significantly improve per- formance on mobile devices

VAOs are available in WebGL 1.0 with the OES_ vertex_array_object
extension, which is widely supported on mobile devices. As of early
2015, more than 80% of smartphone and tablet clients recorded by
WebGL Stats have it 



If vertex array objects (VAOs) are supported, then we build one for
each combination of vertex buffers and index buffer present in the
DrawParameters objects. As we share the buffers between many different
geometries, the actual number of combinations is usually quite
low. This allows us at dispatch time to simplify all the buffer checks
to a single equality comparison between the current VAO and the
previous one. Even when the VAOs are dif- ferent, setting them with
WebGL is cheaper on the CPU than setting all the different buffers and
vertex pointer attributes, which makes them a big win for complex
scenes.


Adding a fallback for devices without VAO support is also
straightforward. Let’s call the code that binds buffers and sets
vertex attrib pointers related to a specific mesh the binding
block. If VAOs are supported, the code should initialize the VAO of
each mesh using the binding block. Then, when the mesh is drawn, the
code either binds the VAO if VAOs are supported, or executes the
binding block if VAOs are not supported. The only case where this
becomes more complicated is when there’s a different number of active
vertex attribute arrays for different meshes—then the code should add
disable- VertexAttribArray calls where appropriate. For a complete
code example, see an explanation of VAOs* or an implementation of a
fallback path in SceneJS
(https://github.com/xeolabs/scenejs/blob/v4.0/src/core/display/chunks/geometryChunk.js)




Lowering the number of vertex buffers helps to reduce CPU usage if
VAOs are not a good fit for the code for some reason. This can be done
by interleaving different types of vertex data for the same object: If
we have, for example, positions, texture coordinates, and normals for
each vertex, they can all be stored in the same vertex buffer in an
interleaved fashion. In our CPU-bound drawing test that uses four
vertex attributes, interleaving the attributes increased the FPS
around 4%. The downside is that interleaving the data needs to be
either handled by the content creation pipeline or done at load time;
the latter may marginally slow down loading. Interleaving three
attributes for a million vertices in a tight JS loop had a cost of
around 200 ms on a Nexus 5 (2013 phone).

**** TODO extend glsl

***** TODO glsl use require,include?
@bhouston what about a custom webpack loader for the glsl files instead of using the raw-loader? The loader could take care of recursively resolving any #include lines in the root shader file. Any shader could be required in with e.g.:

var vert = require('three-glsl!../shaders/my-shader.vert')
var frag = require('three-glsl!../shaders/my-shader.frag')
just a thought

***** We had to write voxelization routines that captured the UV data with no ambiguities.



***** we had to make sure our dual contouring methods could output the UV data back into triangle form.

The realtime compression had to be now aware of the UV space, and remain fast enough for realtime use.
And last but not least we knew voxel content would be edited and modified in many sorts of cruel ways. We had to understand how the UV data would survive (or not) all these
transformations. 

***** internal voxels do not have UV info, but a regular material that is exposed when the surface voxels are gone.
***** Only the surface voxels have UVs.

*** TODO optimize sort render command(WebglRenderer.ts)
use radix sort?

refer to:
https://www.byvoid.com/zhs/blog/sort-radix
http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/node10.html


use web worker to parallel sort:
It is possible to make this last stage of the process parallel by having each sorter ignore any values that it reads
that are outside its working set, meaning that each worker reads through the entire set of values gathering for their
bucket, but there is still a small chance of non-linear performance due to having to write to nearby memory on different
threads. During the time the worker collects the elements for its bucket, it could be generating the counts for the next
radix in the sequence, only requiring a summing before use in the next pass of the data, mitigating the cost of
iterating over the whole set with every worker. 

If your data is not simple enough to radix sort, you might be better off using a merge sort or a quick sort, but there
are other sorts that work very well if you know the length of your sortable buffer at compile time, such as sorting
networks. Through merge-sort is not itself a concurrent algorithm, the many early merges can be run in parallel, only
the final merge is serial, and with a quick pre-parse of the to-be-merged data, you can finalise with two threads rather
than one by starting from both ends (you need to make sure that the mergers don't run out of data). Though quick sort is
not a concurrent algorithm each of the sub stages can be run in parallel. These algorithms are inherently serial, but
can be turned into partially parallelisable algorithms with O(log n) latency. 



Multi-threaded sorting: Each command bucket can be sorted independently, in parallel.

** TODO [#B] optimize
*** TODO compress typeArrays
e.g. Texture typeArray->wrapS, wrapT, ... should share the same Uint8Array with different value range




** TODO [#C] advanced asset
*** TODO support gltf extensions
https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions



*** TODO convert .wd to .gltf
**** TODO fix share material but not share geometry!
(node->extension->material)


*** TODO [#A] add more data in .wd
add:
clone
instance
...



**** TODO material add side




*** TODO optimize generate wd
when generate wd->generate gltf, add extended data:
geometry type(box, customGeometry)


not add box geometry data to buffer!





*** TODO add AssetDatabase to support aync load asset
(move out to be a project in wonder group?)

*** TODO use backgroup task api
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Tasks_API











*** TODO [#B] write fbx python sdk converter
refer to wonder, claygl


use 2019.1 python sdk


should export light data



** TODO [#C] advanced animation
*** TODO skin optimize
**** TODO use blender to build skin animation


fix yuan bao problem:
the animation and the static model's rotation is not the same!(animation has rotate(0,-90,0)!)
(
gltf is correct(monster is correct)(by compare with threejs)

but fbx is wrong!(xsi_man_skinning.fbx)(compare with threejs=>webgl_loader_fbx.html)
maybe the bind shape matrix is wrong? need parse!?
# parse bind shape matrix:
# http://www.gamedev.net/topic/574309-solved-fbx-animation-problems/
# refer to babylonjs=>SkinInfo.cpp=>bindPoses ?)




**** TODO support multi animations in one fbx
pass fbx=>converter=>multi skin animations!:
use blender to add multi animations of one model in one .fbx file
learn how to separate and combine character and its props animations!


**** TODO optimize skin
https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/compressing-skeletal-animation-data




fbx:
  parse bind shape matrix:
  http://www.gamedev.net/topic/574309-solved-fbx-animation-problems/
  refer to babylonjs=>SkinInfo.cpp=>bindPoses ?




optimize: 
not update tranlation,scale(pre handle key frame data)



write to texture:
judge vertex texture


//add basic optimize


add render test


optimize: 
//if bindShapeMatrix is identify, set it null and not multiply

other "todo" optimizes


optimize:
query max uniform data arr count



compute in gpu
1) Make sure that the size of the bones array is correct. Often times, you will find that part of the mesh is skinned fine while the other parts are not skinned correctly. If so make sure the size of the bones array is correct.  

There are two things that you have to be careful about.





**** TODO publish


*** TODO optimize skeleton animation
把所有不同的角色的骨骼相关的矩阵和变换信息写入到纹理里(refer to playcanvas, threejs)
(fallback:if not support vertex texture, pass uniform data instead)
