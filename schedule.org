refer to babylonjs(source code):

Shaders
When WebGL2 is enabled, the shaders are automatically converted to GLSL v3.0. Babylon.js will then automatically take
advantage of extended instruction/uniform counts.

** TODO [#B] dynamic load asset

refer to unity->AssetBundle:

** TODO [#A] extend

*** TODO extend files
extend material(? material asset?), shader(.glsl), job(.js), script(.js), config data(.json->./Wonder.js/data/ json files)


extend service(.js?)





add config(.json) to specific the file structure in project file(.wd_project_package)


*** TODO use .wonder_extend_package package(zip file) to include all extend files

include asset:
e.g.:
.wd
.bin
...









*** TODO extend render config

**** TODO improve shaders.json->branch(static_branch)
remove static_branchs, change to:
        {
          "type": "static_branch",
          "name": "modelMatrix_instance"
        },


add Shaders.re->addBranchHandle api, user can register handle after load(e.g. wd.addBranchHandle("modelMatrix_instance", function(xxx){...}))


**** TODO add custom material+custom shader
***** TODO custom glsl can support instance



**** TODO user can write own .glsl can register to npm
modify render config(shader config json?), support build npm->glsl to ShaderChunk.ts?





**** TODO extend material
user can add custom material, custom glsl, custom shaderLib_generate, custom render module(like defer, front render
module/system)
////(but how to handle render worker?)


user can edit shaders.json, shader_libs.json(e.g. add condition limit so that use one shader lib when in mobile, use
other one when in pc)




**** TODO extend glsl

***** TODO glsl use require,include?
@bhouston what about a custom webpack loader for the glsl files instead of using the raw-loader? The loader could take care of recursively resolving any #include lines in the root shader file. Any shader could be required in with e.g.:

var vert = require('three-glsl!../shaders/my-shader.vert')
var frag = require('three-glsl!../shaders/my-shader.frag')
just a thought








*** TODO extend component
/*
user can write local/public component

add wonder_component_config.json, add "components" field.
e.g.

}

wonder should read this field and register it


public component:
(refer to typescript=>d.ts)
user should send it to public github repository
in ci, it will check and run unit test

after pass ci and merge it, it will be published to @wonder-components/xxx npm package

voxel farm:

http://procworld.blogspot.com/2016/05/applying-textures-to-voxels.html
***** We had to write voxelization routines that captured the UV data with no ambiguities.



***** we had to make sure our dual contouring methods could output the UV data back into triangle form.

The realtime compression had to be now aware of the UV space, and remain fast enough for realtime use.
And last but not least we knew voxel content would be edited and modified in many sorts of cruel ways. We had to understand how the UV data would survive (or not) all these
transformations. 

***** internal voxels do not have UV info, but a regular material that is exposed when the surface voxels are gone.
***** Only the surface voxels have UVs.

*** TODO add Occlusion culling?
Occlusion culling: Calculating which objects are hidden behind other objects and excluding them from rendering.

refer to unity->https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OcclusionCulling.html



** TODO [#A] sort by shader,geometry group, texture

*** TODO optimize sort render command(WebglRenderer.ts)
use radix sort?

refer to:
https://www.byvoid.com/zhs/blog/sort-radix
http://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/node10.html


use web worker to parallel sort:
It is possible to make this last stage of the process parallel by having each sorter ignore any values that it reads
that are outside its working set, meaning that each worker reads through the entire set of values gathering for their
bucket, but there is still a small chance of non-linear performance due to having to write to nearby memory on different
threads. During the time the worker collects the elements for its bucket, it could be generating the counts for the next
radix in the sequence, only requiring a summing before use in the next pass of the data, mitigating the cost of
iterating over the whole set with every worker. 

If your data is not simple enough to radix sort, you might be better off using a merge sort or a quick sort, but there
are other sorts that work very well if you know the length of your sortable buffer at compile time, such as sorting
networks. Through merge-sort is not itself a concurrent algorithm, the many early merges can be run in parallel, only
the final merge is serial, and with a quick pre-parse of the to-be-merged data, you can finalise with two threads rather
than one by starting from both ends (you need to make sure that the mergers don't run out of data). Though quick sort is
not a concurrent algorithm each of the sub stages can be run in parallel. These algorithms are inherently serial, but
can be turned into partially parallelisable algorithms with O(log n) latency. 



Multi-threaded sorting: Each command bucket can be sorted independently, in parallel.
