* TODO 今日计划
** TODO [#A] demo-collider system
many spheres,boxes in room

user interaction(modify GameObject->getTopUnderPoint with collider)

junior collide with each other:
BoxCollider, sphereCollider ...


control ball to move in the room(position):
    refer to unity->physics->Rigidbody

//study:
light ray(光线追踪）

** TODO physics
*** DONE add basic sample
CLOSED: [2015-12-11 Fri 19:54]
//integration cannon.js


////if not add rigid body but add collider, add static rigid body default




//collision

//event

//type


single test k-s, k-d, s-d collison event
sample test event

   refactor




//friction
//bounce

//damping


complete physicsSpec
//edit friction,restitution,damping...

** DONE optimize collider
CLOSED: [2015-12-15 Tue 18:02]
//aabb when rotate, not create buffer, just reset its data
when stop rotate, still create buffer!!!??


//not update collider if has rigid body


** DONE improve sample
CLOSED: [2015-12-15 Tue 23:16]

//change material


//add aabb,sphere

add shadow

//basic camera control



//** TODO add script to control collision
add collision event

////** TODO refactor shadow
not use list, just use cast and receive

** DONE publish v0.2.0
CLOSED: [2015-12-16 Wed 09:14]

////bower not ignore "src/", so it can debug to .ts file



* TODO 明日计划
** TODO add more collider
Cylinder
Mesh


** TODO add obb inserction for box collider

** TODO optimize
use worker for collision(refer to babylon and cannon.js?)

** TODO collider with morph animation?
need run test and unit test



** TODO senior physics
*** TODO add cloth sample
add cloth component

*** TODO add vehicle sample
add wheel component



*** TODO more
support set contact material equation param


support set:
Linear Factor
	Multiplier for a body's linear movement in each world axis. If set to 0 for any axis no movement will occur in this
axis - useful for the creation of 2D games or 1D/2D movement.  
Angular Factor
	Multiplier for a body's angular (rotational) movement about each world axis. If set to 0 for any axis,
no rotation will occur around this axis.


support mesh(convex polyhedron) collision:
refer to cannon->demos/convex.html, babylon->cannonJSPlugin->_createConvexPolyhedron
http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshCollider.html
http://www.gamedev.net/topic/646717-fast-3d-mesh-collision-detection/



sleep

spring

add physics material


*** TODO question
**** how can i compute the aabb of a gameObject which contains children(like .obj model)?
use dynamic aabb tree?


* TODO 未来7日计划
