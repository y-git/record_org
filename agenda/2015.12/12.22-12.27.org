//CharFont extends from Font



//optimize:if not dirty, not update


//CharFont should add UIRenderer of the BitmapFont

//CharFont extends CanvasFont?



//each UIRenderer has one canvas, so they will be independent
//can set zIndex
////UIRenderer can only create canvas once


//refactor BitmapFont,CharFont

//extract FntParser


//extract ComponentContainer from ActionManager,UIManager


//test dispose
////dispose UIManager(GameObject->dispose)






////add showBoarder function

* TODO 明日计划
** TODO Screen Space - Camera
In this mode, the Canvas is rendered as if it were drawn on a plane object some distance in front of a given camera. The
onscreen size of the UI does not vary with the distance since it is always rescaled to fit exactly within the camera
frustum. If the screen’s size or resolution or the camera frustum are changed then the UI will automatically rescale to
fit. Any 3D objects in the scene that are closer to the camera than the UI plane will be rendered in front of the UI,
while objects behind the plane will be obscured. 

http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Canvas.html

** TODO Screen Space - World
This mode renders the UI as if it were a plane object in the scene. Unlike Screen Space - Camera mode, however, the
plane need not face the camera and can be oriented however you like. The size of the Canvas can be set using its Rect
Transform but its onscreen size will depend on the viewing angle and distance of the camera. Other scene objects can
pass behind, through or in front of the Canvas. 

** TODO bind event on font
refer to playcanvas:
Script Events
If you want the rendered text to be clickable you can register an event handler for the 'click' event via script. For example attach this script on the same Entity as the font_renderer:

pc.script.create('myhandler', function (context) {
    var Myhandler = function (entity) {
        this.entity = entity;
    };

    Myhandler.prototype = {
        initialize: function () {
            this.entity.script.font_renderer.on('click', this.onClick, this);
        },

        onClick: function () {
            console.log('Click');
        }
    };

    return MyHandler;
});


* TODO 未来7日计划
