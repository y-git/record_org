** TODO [#A] optimize

performance check

cache
SIMD support

memory management

***** TODO [#A] optimize render(batch render,combine mesh...)

***** TODO [#A] solve the three problem:
solve '"reflection_light" demo become more and more slow when run' problem
solve '"dynamic_cubemap_xxx" demo become more and more slow when run' problem

optimize car demo

***** TODO layers
add a demo to show 3 meshes, use tag and layer(camera selective show)
http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html
http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TagManager.html
***** TODO add data collector

***** cubemap optimize
• Dynamic Cube Maps don’t have to be full resolution
• They also don’t need updating every frame
• Allowing updates to lag behind a frame prevents stalling in some cases


***** optimize:
optimize renderer: [[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html][unity->batch draw]], dirty, layer(refer to Wozlla)
combineMesh?
add mesh/geometry merge method(refer to threejs->src->core->Geometry)

***** memory management
***** optimize Scene->update,renderer by using data locality
refer to http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/data-locality.html -> sample code

first, get all need update/renderer components of all gameObject
second, update/render them



test the performance improvement by profile

***** more
gameObject add active flag

**** reason
memory leak, it causes 4 garbage collection in one frame that cost most time!


**** where leak memory?

createCamera:
release

not create every loop


*** DONE optimize "shadow_direction_shadowMap"
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 20:41]
modify TwoDRenderTargetRenderer->renderFrameBufferTexture:
dispose camera created before


*** DONE optimize car demo
CLOSED: [2016-01-23 Sat 21:29]

disable contract check(set Main->isTest to be false)
